## Overview

This project involves creating a Sales Dashboard in Power BI to provide key insights into sales performance using various data sources. The dashboard integrates multiple datasets, performs necessary transformations, applies DAX calculations, and presents the findings using interactive visualizations. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making for stakeholders by showcasing revenue, profit, sales trends, and key performance metrics in a single-page report.

## Objectives

- **Automate Data Integration:** Load multiple yearly sales files dynamically into a single fact table without manual intervention.

- **Data Transformation & Modeling:** Clean and structure data for effective relationships and analysis, including splitting locations, formatting dates, and removing redundant ID prefixes.

- **DAX Calculations:** Implement key measures such as Total Revenue, Total Cost, Gross Profit, MoM Growth, QoQ Growth, and Average Sales per Day.

- **Power BI Deployment:** Publish the dashboard on Power BI Service, create an App, implement Row-Level Security (RLS), and set up a scheduled data refresh.

## Challenges & Learnings

- **Data Integration & Automation:** Implemented a resilient mechanism to dynamically load sales files, preventing errors due to missing or additional files.

- **Data Cleaning & Modeling:** Transformed raw data into a structured model, ensuring proper relationships between fact and dimension tables.

- **Advanced DAX Calculations:** Learned to optimize performance while calculating revenue, cost, and profit measures efficiently.

- **Time Intelligence Measures:** Implemented QoQ and MoM growth calculations to track performance over time.

- **Power BI Deployment & Security:** Successfully deployed on Power BI Service, created an App, and set up Dynamic & Static RLS for user access control.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in end-to-end Power BI dashboard development, from data integration, transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization to publishing, security, and scheduling refreshes. The final dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to analyze sales performance and drive business decisions effectively.
